# Competencies: Senior UI Engineer
Senior UI is a senior individual contributor level. Engineers at this level are expected to work
with a high degree of autonomy and contribute beyond their immediate tickets.

## Technical Excellence
- Delivers high-quality, production-ready UI code with minimal rework.
- Demonstrates deep understanding of at least one specialization area
  (e.g., accessibility, design systems, performance, testing).
- Proactively identifies technical risks or issues before they become blockers.
- Writes code that others can maintain and build on.

## Delivery & Ownership
- Consistently meets commitments and communicates proactively when timelines shift.
- Takes end-to-end ownership of features — from scoping to deployment and monitoring.
- Does not require close supervision on well-defined work.

## Collaboration & Communication
- Participates actively in team discussions, standups, and planning sessions.
- Raises blockers and proposes solutions rather than waiting for direction.
- Gives and receives feedback constructively.
- Collaborates effectively with design, product, and QA.

## Technical Leadership (growth area at Senior)
- Begins contributing to solutioning and design discussions, not just implementation.
- Shares knowledge through code reviews, pair programming, or informal mentoring.
- Helps improve team practices (e.g., testing standards, documentation, tooling).

## Impact
- Contributions are felt at the team level — not just in individual tasks.
- Work is visible and valued by cross-functional partners (design, QA, product).
