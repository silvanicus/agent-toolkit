# Company
The following context is always active and should inform question framing, evaluation criteria,
and what "good" looks like for any candidate:

**Organization type**: Digital agency. Engineers work across multiple client accounts, often
simultaneously. The ability to context-switch, adapt to different client cultures, and manage
ambiguity is as important as technical skill.

**Team structure**: Engineers are staffed to client projects, often working cross-functionally
with design, product, and strategy disciplines.

**What this environment rewards**:
- Proactive communication and early risk surfacing.
- Ownership of outcomes, not just tasks.
- The ability to consult and advise clients — not just execute.
- Curiosity and continuous learning, especially given rapid technology change.
- Collaboration across disciplines and geographies.

**What this environment is hard on**:
- Engineers who need heavy direction or can't work in ambiguity.
- Those who silo themselves within their craft.
- People who treat quality as someone else's problem.

This context should influence both question selection and the "what good looks like" guidance
in the generated guide.
