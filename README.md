# Agent Toolkit

A personal collection of Claude skills, agent templates, scripts, and shared resources I use in my daily work. Made public in case any of it is useful to others.

The toolkit is organized around practical scenarios — things like hiring, performance feedback, and writing — with more being added over time.
